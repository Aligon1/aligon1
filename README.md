 - While pursuing my degree I am also a biorepository research coordinator in the Loyola University Healthcare System

 - I have a BA in biology where I spent 4 years in a marine research group conducting environmental and oceanographic research off the coast of California. I was also a member of a computational biology lab where I focused on predictive climate modeling and species distribution maps.
 
 - Most of my experience is with Python and R - I am currently learning SQL

 - Through my program and internships I have lead projects and developed pipelines involving:
   - clinical microbiology, metagenomics, local ancestry inference, NGS, long-read shotgun sequencing, taxonomic classification, functional profiling, software benchmarking, microbiome analysis, comparative genomices, and strain level identification

 - I'm always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and collaborate on exciting projects
